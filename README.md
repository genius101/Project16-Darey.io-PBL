# AUTOMATE INFRASTRUCTURE WITH IAC USING TERRAFORM PART 1

After you have built AWS infrastructure for 2 websites manually, it is time to automate the process using Terraform.

Let us start building the same set up with the power of Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### Prerequisites before you begin writing Terraform code

- You must have completed Terraform course from the Learning dashboard

- Create an IAM user, name it terraform (ensure that the user has only programatic access to your AWS account) and grant this user AdministratorAccess permissions.

- Copy the secret access key and access key ID. Save them in a notepad temporarily.

- Configure programmatic access from your workstation to connect to AWS using the access keys copied above and a Python SDK (boto3). You must have Python 3.6 or higher on your workstation.

- Create an S3 bucket to store Terraform state file. You can name it something like yourname-dev-terraform-bucket

- When you have configured authentication and installed boto3, make sure you can programmatically access your AWS account by running following commands in python:

        import boto3
        s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
        for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
            print(bucket.name)

## Part 1 â€“ VPC | Subnets | Security Groups

### Let us create a directory structure

Open your Visual Studio Code and:

- Create a folder called PBL

- Create a file in the folder, name it main.tf

Your setup should look like this:

Set up Terraform CLI as per this instruction below.

- Add AWS as a provider, and a resource to create a VPC in the main.tf file.

- Provider block informs Terraform that we intend to build infrastructure within AWS.

- Resource block will create a VPC.

        provider "aws" {
          region = "us-east-2"
        }

        # Create VPC
        resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
          cidr_block                     = "172.16.0.0/16"
          enable_dns_support             = "true"
          enable_dns_hostnames           = "true"
          enable_classiclink             = "false"
          enable_classiclink_dns_support = "false"
        }

The next thing is to download necessary plugins for Terraform to work. Lets accomplish this with terraform init command as seen in the below demonstration.

Next, let us create the only resource we just defined: aws_vpc.

Run terraform plan

Then, if you are happy with changes planned, execute terraform apply
